                    I am currently an <strong>F-1 student</strong>, and due to visa sponsorship requirements, I have been rejected by many companies. However, if your company is willing to offer me an opportunity, <strong>I am willing to work without requiring H-1B sponsorship</strong>. I have around four years of experience in software development, and I am confident in my ability to perform well in this role. I am also the first person in my family in over two hundred years to study abroad in the United States.
